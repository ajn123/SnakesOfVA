"Snakes_About" = "  Regardless of their source, misconceptions about snakes have made them among the most persecuted of all animals. A common reaction to a snake is to kill it on sight whether or not it poses a danger. However, the fact is that most snakes are harmless, and even dangerous ones would rather flee than fight. Once we begin to learn about snakes, we can replace our misconceptions with facts and our fears with curiosity, and we can begin to appreciate their important roles in our environment. Snakes are reptiles and belong to the same group of animals as lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. Reptiles have dry scales that are shed periodically. Sometimes confused with reptiles, amphibians such as frogs and salamanders always lack scales and most have moist skin. Unlike mammals and birds, reptiles cannot generate their own body heat and depend on outside sources to raise their body temperature. This trait obligates them to wait out long periods of extensive cold and hot conditions, a habit that contributes to their secretive nature. Snakes differ from other reptiles by having no legs, external ears, or eyelids. The most notable characteristic of a snake is its extremely long, slender body. A snake's body allows it to effortlessly climb, swim, and slip into the smallest spaces. Instead of eyelids, snakes have a clear scale covering each eye. The shedding of this scale causes the eye to cloud over with a bluish tint for a few days. \n  Worldwide there are over 3,000 snake species distributed throughout every continent except Antarctica. There are 34 types in Virginia. They occur across the Commonwealth from coastal marshes, agricultural fields, and abandoned buildings, to Piedmont forests and mountain ridge tops. Within these habitats, snakes play important roles as both predator and prey. All snakes eat other animals, and none feed on plants. Snakes are able to swallow prey whole because their jaws are loosely attached together. Major prey includes insects, fish, amphibians, other reptiles, birds and their eggs, and rodents. Some snakes have very specialized diets of only one or two prey types. Certain mammals, birds, and humans are significant predators of snakes.";


// Snake Identification Tips

"Snake_Identification_Tips" = "  Virginia's snake species exhibit a wide variety of colors, patterns, shapes, and sizes. Anyone can identify most species by learning a few basic features. As a general rule for proper identification, it is better to use a combination of characters instead of one. You will find that patterns on the snake's back and belly will aid in identification.\n  When trying to identify a snake, you will probably go directly to the photographs. Remember that these photographs represent only a few specimens and does not account for the tremendous variation that occurs within many species. The text accompanying each photograph will describe these variations and any other distinguishing characteristics. The young of some snake species appear distinctly different than the adults. In these cases, an accompanying photograph and description will help in identification. The most important identifying characteristics to learn are the differences between venomous and nonvenomous snakes  \n  The timber rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth are the only venomous snake species in Virginia. They are collectively known as pit vipers. The 'pit' is a heat- sensing organ used to detect birds and small mammals. It appears as a small hole between the eye and nostril on each side of the head. All pit vipers are heavy-bodied and have vertical cat-like pupils, a single row of scales underneath the tail, and a pair of large, hollow fangs. Although all of Virginia's venomous snakes have a distinctly broadened head relative to their neck, some nonvenomous snakes also share this trait. Thus, 'head wider than neck' is not a useful way of determining whether a snake is venomous. Because a snake can bite for a distance up to half its body length, you should keep a safe distance when attempting to identify these animals Each species is shown with a distribution map of where it is known to occur. Proper identification is much easier if you know where you observed your specimen in relation to its known range. Many snakes are limited to small sections of the Commonwealth while others occur statewide. A good example is the venomous cottonmouth, which is often confused with the nonvenomous northern watersnake. The cottonmouth occurs only in the southeastern portion of the state, but the northern watersnake occurs statewide. A snake observed in waters outside of southeastern Virginia is very likely to be a nonvenomous watersnake.";


"Snake_Conservation" = "  Snakes play an invaluable role in controlling many pests. Mice and rats destroy millions of dollars in wheat, corn, and other crops every year. Rodents directly and indirectly spread many diseases including hantavirus, leptospirosis, lymphocytic chorio-meningitis (LCM), salmonellosis, tularemia, babesiosis, and Lyme disease. Without predators like snakes, mice that can produce 50 offspring a year per female would soon become a serious problem. Many farmers know that the best way to control mice is to keep a ratsnake in the barn. Snakes in the garden are helpful in controlling common pests such as harmful insects, slugs, and snails. Snake venom is being researched as a treatment for cancer, epilepsy, arthritis, and other human diseases. It is an unfortunate fact of modern life that snakes are not as abundant as they once were. Destruction of habitat due to urban sprawl, pollution, and deforestation have caused many species to decline or even disappear from many parts of the Commonwealth. Needless persecution by people who run them over in cars or kill them on sight contributes to this problem. Unless you have no reasonable alternative but to kill a snake, it should be left alone.\n  Like all wildlife, snakes occupy a critical role in the web of life on which we all depend. Loss of any species, even unpopular ones, could cause this web to unravel. Overall, snakes are sources of wonder in nature and remind us that we are part of the natural world. They are beautiful creatures that deserve our respect and protection. There are many ways you can help conserve and protect snakes and other wild animals:\n  • Support efforts to establish and protect natural areas.\n  • Keep portions of your property ungrazed, unmowed, untimbered, and undeveloped; you will be amazed by the amount of wildlife it attracts.\n  • Reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides in your yard and garden.\n  • Recycle and do not litter or pollute.\n  • Join a conservation organization.\n  • Do not kill snakes.\n  • Educate yourself and others about this unique group of Virginia's wildlife. \n";


"Living_With_Snakes" = "  Snakes occur in many different places, including yards in rural and suburban areas. Most species are small and secretive and are seldom seen by homeowners, but larger snakes can create quite a commotion. If you live near a creek, woods, or fields, then snakes may occasionally show up in your yard. The best way to deal with snakes is to educate yourself, your children, and your neighbors about them. Remember that you have invaded the snake's world, not the other way around. By realizing that snakes are part of the local wildlife (just like songbirds and squirrels) and a sign of a healthy environment, you may even enjoy the prospect of a snake residing on or visiting your property. Snakes will stay in an area only if appropriate food and shelter are present. If you eliminate these, snakes will leave. Thus, if you wish to discourage snakes from inhabiting your yard, try the following:\n  1) Regularly mow your lawn short.\n  2) Eliminate hiding places for mice, rats, and other small animals that would be food for snakes.\n  3) Remove snake shelter such as brush piles, thickets, and lumber.\n  4) Reduce low shrubs where snakes can ambush their prey.\n  5) Do not leave out birdseed and pet food that attract prey for snakes.\n  There is no government-approved chemical that will deter all snakes from your yard.\n  A snake in your home is the most difficult situation for all concerned, including the snake. A snake is usually in your house to find food such as mice and rats. Eliminating the food source will likely rid you of your snake problem. Almost all snakes that enter homes are nonvenomous species. A snake can enter any opening that a mouse can squeeze through. Sealing all crevices and spaces where pipes and electrical wires enter the dwelling will help prevent snakes from making your house their home. If you find a snake in your house, remove it by sweeping the snake into a trash can with a broom or having someone experienced with snakes catch it. Any captured snake should be released to the nearest nonresidential area. Government agency personnel normally will not come to your house to remove a snake, and private companies will charge to have it removed. Search the Internet or phone book for a telephone number of a reputable nuisance wildlife control company.";



"Snake_Bite" = "  Although it may provide little comfort, each year bee stings, lightening strikes, and horses kill more people in Virginia than venomous snakes do. Only five deaths in Virginia have been attributed to venomous snakebites since 1948, and three of those involved people intentionally handling snakes. Not all bites inject venom; at least one in five is a 'dry' bite. Of the three venomous species in Virginia, copperheads have the least potency. Bites from cottonmouths and timber rattlesnakes are potentially deadly if left untreated. The severity of the bite depends on its location on the body, the type of snake, and the sensitivity, age, and health of the person bitten. Remember that venomous snakes are not purposely lying in wait or on the prowl for some unsuspecting person to bite. In fact, the primary purpose of venom is to capture small animals efficiently for food. Snakes, including venomous ones, would rather flee than confront an adversary as large as a person. You can prevent unpleasant encounters by following these simple rules:\n  1) Learn about snakes and their environments so that you can identify and avoid venomous species.\n  2) Never put your hands and feet or sit in places you cannot see.\n  3) Stay on paths and avoid tall grass, underbrush, and rocky bluffs that may harbor venomous snakes.\n  4) When you encounter one, leave the snake alone and do not attempt to kill it.\n  5) Do not handle a freshly killed snake. It can still bite.\n\n  In case of a venomous snakebite\n  1) Remain calm - a snakebite is rarely fatal. \n  2) Do not drink alcohol or apply a constrictive tourniquet or ice to the wound.\n  3) Identify the snake if it will not put you at risk or waste valuable time.\n  4) Keep the bitten body part immobilized and if possible level with the heart.\n  5) Seek immediate medical attention.";
